<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->

## Architecture

The Todo List app follows a client-server architecture, utilizing the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages a modern JavaScript framework, such as React or Vue.js, for efficient rendering and handling user interactions.
- **Backend**: The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js. It provides RESTful APIs to handle task management operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. The data is stored in a database, such as MongoDB, for persistence.
- **Database**: The app utilizes a NoSQL database, like MongoDB, to store task data. The database ensures reliable and scalable storage of tasks and allows for efficient retrieval and modification of task information.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization are implemented using a secure authentication mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to ensure that each user's tasks are private and only accessible to authorized individuals.
<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

The following features and enhancements are planned for the future releases of the Todo List app:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Enable users to register accounts, login, and manage their tasks securely.
2. **Task Prioritization**: Implement the ability to assign priority levels to tasks for better organization and focus.
3. **Task Categories and Tags**: Introduce the concept of categories and tags to allow users to group and label tasks based on their own preferences.
4. **Task Reminders and Notifications**: Add functionality to set reminders for tasks and receive notifications to stay on top of deadlines.
5. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Enable users to collaborate on tasks and share task lists with other users, facilitating team collaboration and task delegation.
6. **Data Synchronization**: Implement data synchronization across multiple devices, ensuring that tasks are seamlessly accessible from various platforms.
